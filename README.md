# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Overview 

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to analyze Amazon reviews written by memebers of Amazon Vine, a paid review program. This program allows manufactuers and publishers gauge consumer perception. The user is to see if there is bias in any reviews based on whether or not they were compensated. Is there a difference in the amount of 5-star reviews for paid vs. unpaid reviews?

### Results 

51% of 5 star reviews were paid.

### Summary

There is a strong possibility of bias from paid-reviewers toward five-star reviewers. One must see if they receieve additional payments when they give five-star reviews? Are these reviews "reviewed"? There must be further study to confirm the positive coorelation between payment and positive reviews. We must find more samples to analyze such as the tendencies of 1-4 star reviewers and their relationship to the Vine program. We can also analyze the depth of review (heavily-written, sentence content) to see the efforts of writing in regards to payment or non-payment.
